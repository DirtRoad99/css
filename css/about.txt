Regardless of who you are, 
or what you’re into, 
I can pretty much guarantee you’re familiar 
with the base ten female rating scale.


The problem with this scale is every man has created
his own definition of what each number represents.
One man’s 2 can be another man’s 10.
This is a quirk of life we should all be thankful for as every time a guy 
takes a dive we not only pull the grenade from the game,
but it’s just one less guy to usurp in the field.

For this reason alone, any guy happily out hogging should be left to do so in peace. 
While you might not want to see your buddy leave with iZumba, he’s doing a service to everyone else in the game.
Plus if that’s what gets him off, who are you to deprive him?
